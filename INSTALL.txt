BUILD DEPENDENCIES
==============
(this will work on Ubuntu12.x/Debian 6, you have to adjust according to your distro)

# Debian package dependencies
sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev gccxml libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost1.42-dev libboost_system1.42-dev libboost_thread1.42-dev libboost-filesystem1.42-dev libboost-program-options1.42-dev 

# installs the ruby GCCXML client gem without compiling the 'gccxml' executable
# since it was delivered by Debian package
sudo gem1.9.1 install gccxml_gem --platform ruby
sudo gem1.9.1 install mongrel --pre
sudo gem1.9.1 install rspec bit-struct onstomp

GCCXML alternative install
==================
The alternative path is to install GCCXML from Ruby's gem package management. 
Do this ONLY if you have a fairly older gcc, otherwise you WILL get errors during building like
"gccxml-builtins.h: no such file or directory"

sudo gem1.9.1 install rbgccxml
