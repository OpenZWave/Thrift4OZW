BUILD DEPENDENCIES
==================
(this will work on Ubuntu12.x/Debian 6, you have to adjust according to your distro)

# Install development environment
sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libudev-dev libtool autoconf

# Debian package dependencies
sudo apt-get install libboost1.42-dev libboost_system1.42-dev libboost_thread1.42-dev libboost-filesystem1.42-dev libboost-program-options1.42-dev

# Ubuntu has a convenience package for all Boost dev libs, much more elegant!
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev 

1a) Install GCCXML + its Ruby bindings (Ubuntu/Debian) 
======================================================
# installs GCCXML binary from the package repository
sudo apt-get install gccxml
# install gccxml_gem and RbGCCXML for Ruby, see also: https://github.com/jasonroelofs/rbgccxml
sudo gem install gccxml_gem --platform ruby
sudo gem install rbgccxml

1b) OR, install RBGCCXML directly via ruby gems 
====================================
The alternative path is to install the GCCXML+ all its dependencies from Ruby's gem package management. 
Do this try this ONLY if you have a fairly older gcc(4.3 or earlier), otherwise you WILL SURELY get errors in compilation, like this: 
     "gccxml-builtins.h: no such file or directory"
Which simply translates that the version of gccxml that was fetched+compiled by gem is so old that it 
does NOT support your shiney new gcc that came with your shiney Ubuntu Zapey Zakalope. 

# Cross your fingers 
sudo gem install rbgccxml 

2) install BoostStomp
=====================
git clone https://github.com/ekarak/BoostStomp
cd BoostStomp
make && sudo make install
# Also install these gems for STOMP protocol support in Ruby
sudo gem install bit-struct onstomp

3) install Apache Thrift
========================
# various Ruby gems (used for Thrift's Ruby library unit tests)
sudo gem install mongrel --pre
sudo gem install rspec

git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/thrift.git thrift
cd thrift
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make && sudo make install


4) download OpenZWave
=====================
svn checkout http://open-zwave.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ open-zwave-read-only
cd open-zwave-read-only/cpp/build/linux
make

5) compile ozwd!
================
cd Thrift4Ozw
sudo make openzwave-install
make
